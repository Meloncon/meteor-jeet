meteor-jeet
===========

Jeet wrapped to work with meteor.

Jeet takes the best of the open source HTML5/CSS3 World and combines it into a lightweight, semantic, responsive, and blazing fast framework. You can use Stylus, or SCSS, OR BOTH!

To use:
Simply type 'mrt add jeet'

This package is currently a very, very early release and does not pull the latest Jeet Framework from GitHub. It currently only supports the Stylus option for Jeet. Support for SCSS and always up-to-date Jeet is on its way.

In essence it requires the meteor "Stylus" package, which looks for .scss files and compiles them. It presents the available framework to you for use in your own stylus files. (In theory, at least)
